    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a results-driven Marketing Management graduate with over 5 years of hands-on experience in sales, marketing, and business development. I’ve worked across a range of industries — from hospitality and recruitment to manufacturing — bringing energy and strategic focus to every project.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths lie in lead generation, proposal writing, outbound cold calling, customer relationship management, and crafting data-driven marketing strategies. I thrive on solving problems, adapting quickly, and delivering measurable results that drive growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it's connecting with clients or building brand momentum, I bring passion, precision, and a goal-oriented mindset to everything I do.
